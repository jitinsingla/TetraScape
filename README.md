# TetraScape
### Dedicated to John Conway
The design language employed in the **TetraScape** plugin for creating **TetraChain** and **TetraMass** models has been thoroughly detailed by the authors in earlier Structure paper (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.str.2022.01.002). These models are constructed using a regular tetrahedron as the fundamental building block. This design approach enables users to produce protein models with distinctive silhouettes. It allows the rendering of proteins at amino acid-level detail, with the option to represent the remaining parts using a volumetric rendering technique referred to as "massing." This flexibility provides two modeling options: TetraChain models, which represent the entire protein at the amino acid level, and TetraMass models, which utilize a combination of detailed rendering and massing to create multi-resolution representations.

More details about the plugin and TetraChain and TetraMass models is described in the paper: (Coming Soon...)
